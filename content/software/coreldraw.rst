* Copying objects

  - `num-plus` duplicate with 0 distance [*]_

  - `ctrl-d` duplicate with distance set in the toolbar [*]_

  - `right-click` when dragging

  - `space` when dragging

  - `ctrl-r` repeat last action


.. [*] Non-remappable to other keys other than by creating a macros

.. [*] Starts 'duplication mode':Â  records copied movement and rotation and applies them (instead of the distance from the toolbar and zero rotation) on subsequent `ctrl-d` strokes until another object is selected (resetting distance and rotation to original).
